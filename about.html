            <p>M.O.F.O., the Meat Over Fire Organization, is a private grilling club with an exclusive membership. "Meatings" present the members with a rare opportunity for comradery, libations, succulent grilled meat, and private conversations normally only found in the locker room. M.O.F.O. is a private treehouse - everyone wants to know the secret knock, but only the members do. Their secret handshake is a smoke signal. But perhaps one day you too will be invited to join them around the fire in a more primal environment not often found in a time when cell phones don't stop ringing and emails don't stop piling up.</p>
            <p>The idea of M.O.F.O. was born from an ignorance of how to properly cook meat over fire. The founders challenged themselves to cook multiple cuts of meat all in one night on a blazing grill, just to see if it could be done. Several varieties of meat were chosen for the first M.O.F.O. event. God-forbid one of the cuts of meat was ruined; there was more meat to be had. All the stars aligned and each cut was cooked to perfection that first evening, and from there grew a desire to repeat the experience, changing up the menu each time.</p>

            <p>Now to "the meat of the matter." Every M.O.F.O. meating begins with an appetizer of lollypop lambchops seared to perfection. Multiple courses of meat follow one-by-one from the smoking grill. Popular meats of past menus have included... The lomo al tropo, a succulent, flavorful beef tenderloin whose meat is never kissed by a flame. It is uniquely prepared on a bed of salt, wrapped in a blanket of muslin and cooked directly on a bed of piping-hot coals. Standing rib roast, effectionately known as prime rib, prepared unlike any prime rib you would find at a brunch buffet. It is infused with garlic and gently flavored with choice woodsmoke, cooked to a perfect medium rare and accompanied by its own au jus. As each meat on the menu leaves the grill, the only tools available are a cloth napkin, a glass for your drink, and your hands. Each meal is finished with everyone's favorite dessert: grilled bacon. A unique menu is prepared for each meating, every item hand-selected and influenced by the season, the weather, and the exclusive cuts available at the butcher.</p>
